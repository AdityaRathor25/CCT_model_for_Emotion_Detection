# CCT_model_for_Emotion_Detection
This repository implements a Compact Convolutional Transformer (CCT) model for emotion detection using the FER2013 dataset. The model combines convolutional layers with transformer mechanisms to accurately classify emotions from facial expressions, offering a compact and efficient solution for emotion recognition tasks.
